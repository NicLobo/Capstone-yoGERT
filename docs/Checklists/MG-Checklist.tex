% Show an item is done by   \item[\done] Frame the problem
% Show an item will not be fixed by   \item[\wontfix] profit

\begin{itemize}
 
\item Follows writing checklist (full checklist provided in a separate document)
  \begin{todolist}
  \item \LaTeX{} points
  \item Structure
  \item Spelling, grammar, attention to detail
  \item Avoid low information content phrases
  \item Writing style
  \end{todolist}

\item Module Decomposition
  \begin{todolist}
  \item One module one secret (unless an explicit exception is made, with a good
    reason) - all ``and''s should be checked.
  \item The uses relation is a hierarchy.
  \item Secrets are nouns (generally).
  \item Traceability matrix between modules and requirements shows every
    requirement is satisfied by at least on module
  \item Traceability matrix between modules and requirements shows that every
    module is used to satisfy at least one requirement
  \item Traceability matrix between likely changes and modules shows a one to
    one mapping, or, if this is not the case, explains the exceptions to this
    rule.
  \item Level 1 of the decomposition by secrets shows: Hardware-Hiding,
    Behaviour-Hiding and Software Decision Hiding.
  \item Behaviour-Hiding modules are related to the requirements
  \item Software-Decision hiding modules are concepts that need to be
    introduced, but are not detailed in the requirements
  \item Each Software Decision Hiding module is used by at least one
    Behaviour-Hiding Module (if this isn't the case, an explanation should be
    provided)
  \item Uses relation is not confused with a data flow chart
  \item Anticipated changes are a superset of the likely changes in the SRS
  \end{todolist}

\item MG quality
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Follow template
  \item Low coupling
  \item Satisfies information hiding
  \end{todolist}
\end{itemize}
